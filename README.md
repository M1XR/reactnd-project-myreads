# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

With the MyReads app you can categorize books into the shelves 'currently reading', 'want to read' and 'read'.
On the Search page you can search for more books and add them to the shelves in the Main page.

## Install

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Run

- run the server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
